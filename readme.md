# Favicon CLI

This CLI makes it easy to generate the set of favicons as suggested in [How to favicon in 2021](https://evilmartians.com/chronicles/how-to-favicon-in-2021-six-files-that-fit-most-needs). The starting point for this is a `favicon.svg` of size at **least 512x512**. Run the command

```
npx favicon-cli
```

in the folder containing this file (should be the root of your project, `public` folder or equivalent)

This will generate files in a range of sizes and log to the terminal what you need to add to your HTML
