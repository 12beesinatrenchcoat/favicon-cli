# Favicon CLI

This CLI makes it easy to generate the set of favicons as suggested in [How to favicon in 2021](https://evilmartians.com/chronicles/how-to-favicon-in-2021-six-files-that-fit-most-needs). The starting point for this is creating a `favicon.svg` in the root of your project (or a `public` folder etc). Run the command

```
npx favicon-cli
```

in the folder containing this file

This will generate files in a range of sizes and log to the terminal what you need to add to your HTML
